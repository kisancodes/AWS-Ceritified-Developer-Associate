## AWS Regions
The AWS Cloud spans 77 Availability Zones within 24 geographic regions around the world, with announced plans for 18 more Availability Zones and 6 more AWS Regions in Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Spain, and Switzerland.


## AWS Availability Zones (AZ)
An Availability Zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region. AZâ€™s give customers the ability to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data center.
